    "ANS -  The properties are much simpler to use and understand. Simply says it can convert the method as an attribute. Like we have a method in our class and if we add @property as a decorator of that function then we can use that function or method as an attribute means we no longer need to use () like calling a function.\n",

    "ANS - Descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed. Properties are a high-level application of this; that is, properties are implemented using descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The property function gives us a handy way to implement a simple descriptor without defining a separate class. Rather than create a complete class definition, we can write getter and setter method functions, and then bind these functions to an attribute name.\n",
