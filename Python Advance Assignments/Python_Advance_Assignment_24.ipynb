    "ANS - Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in **MOD1.py** file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say **MOD2.PY** file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an **import error**.\n",
    "\n",

    "ANS - During the time of execution of the code if we want to refer the module in which we are working on then we uses name attribute. In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string __ main __"
