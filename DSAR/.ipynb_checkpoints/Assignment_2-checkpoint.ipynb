    "    1. Machine learning and predictive analytics are two great methods and technologies for helping banks and their customers remain protected in the digital age. These technologies can detect network intrusions, secure user authorization, analyze a company’s cybersecurity, and predict hacking. Biometric technologies are believed to address security and privacy issues with greater efficiency. The development of biometrics can help to prevent fraud and money laundering. Moreover, users find instant authentication based on the iris and fingertips scanning more beneficial than the need for memorizing codes, pins, and passwords. Blockchain technology is also a great troubleshooter when it comes to cyber-security.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Blockchain is discussed as the solution to issues around official authentication and security of virtual payments. Extreme transparency and comprehensive codes are proving to be the safest form of transaction protection against fraud and hacking, increasing the reliability of banking transactions several times over. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Storing data is another regulatory concern banks are faced with. Cloud computing are a great way to assure maximum saftey and reliability.\n",

    "    3.Chatbots in Banking have already proved they can help create a more positive experience. So what is a chatbot in banking, and how can it solve issues? Chatbot technologies offer an automated, easy-to-use, launch-and-maintain system that promises to reduce customer care call volumes and increase satisfaction while potentially helping change customers’ opinions of banks. Integrating chatbots into customer service systems increases clients’ loyalty, reduces processing time, and cuts administrative costs. Bots help to find transactions, send and receive money, lock and unlock debit cards and much more."
